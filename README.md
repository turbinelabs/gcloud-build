# GCloud SDK Build Image

[![Apache 2.0](https://img.shields.io/hexpm/l/plug.svg)](LICENSE)

This is an image intended to be used as a build base image in a CI
environment. It's based on the
[official CloudSDK alpine image](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-sdk-docker/blob/master/alpine/Dockerfile),
however it also includes docker and kubectl so you can build and deploy docker
images. It will also automatically configure gcloud to access a specific GKE
cluster based on environment variables.

## Requirements

To build this project you will
need [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/). To deploy a project
to GCloud you'll need a [GCloud Account](https://cloud.google.com/) account.

## Running

This image uses environment variables to configure GCloud authentication,
project ids, compute zones and cluster names. Observed environment variables are

* GOOGLE_AUTH - an base64 encoded [service account key](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/getting-started)
* GCLOUD_PROJECT_ID - the ID (not name!) of the project you wish to work with
* GCLOUD_COMPUTE_ZONE - the compute zone your cluster is located in
* GCLOUD_CLUSTER_NAME - the name of the cluster you wish to work with

Given the length of the GOOGLE_AUTH variable we suggest you keep these values in
a file, e.g.

```
GOOGLE_AUTH=<your base64 encoded service account key>
GCLOUD_PROJECT_ID=<your project ID>
GCLOUD_COMPUTE_ZONE=<your compute zone>
GCLOUD_CLUSTER_NAME=<your cluster name>
```

CloudSDK configuration is performed when the run level is changed to "boot". To
use the container to execute builds you can run

```console
docker run --env-file <your settings> -it turbinelabs/gcloud-build:latest /bin/bash

open rc boot
```

## Building

If you want to build your own image you can run the following:

```
docker build -t turbinelabs/gcloud-build:local .
```

By default this will build an Alpine Linux 3.5 image with GCloud SDK version
168.0.0 and docker. You can override the GCloud SDK version by setting the
CLOUD_SDK_VERSION environment variable. You can then use your locally built
image by running:

```console
docker run --env-file <your settings> -it turbinelabs/gcloud-build:latest /bin/bash

open rc boot
```
